                    And with audio raytracing, Vision Pro <br>
                    analyzes your room's acoustic properties — <br>
                    including the physical materials — to adapt <br>
                    and match sound to your space.

                1. Testing conducted by Apple in May 2023 using preproduction Apple Vision Pro units and software. Testing <br>
                   consisted of full battery discharge while performing each of the following tasks: video playback, <br>
                   internet browsing, spatial video capture, and FaceTime. Video playback tested in conjunction with an <br>
                   Environment, using 2D movie content purchased from the Apple TV app. Internet browsing tested using 20 <br>
                   popular websites. FaceTime tested between two Apple Vision Pro units with Personas enabled. Tested with <br>
                   Wi-Fi associated to a network. Battery life depends on device settings, usage, network, environmental <br>
                   conditions, and many other factors. Battery tests are conducted using specific Apple Vision Pro units; <br>
                   actual results may vary. <br><br>
                2. Valid prescription required. Not all prescriptions are supported. Vision correction accessories are sold <br>
